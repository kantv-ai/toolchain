# Compliance Statement

Currently, Qualcomm's Hexagon SDK can't downloaded automatically via the script [build-run-ggmlhexagon-android.sh](https://github.com/zhouwg/ggml-hexagon/blob/self-build/scripts/build-run-ggmlhexagon-android.sh) because of well-known and make-sense IPR policy. I provide a customized&tailored minimal Hexagon SDK to **simplify workflow** of build ggml-hexagon under the premise of **strictly abiding by Qualcomm's IPR policy.**  At the same time, I strongly recommend that developers should obtain the fully Hexagon SDK with a valid Qualcomm Developer Account because this minimal-hexagon-sdk only used for build ggml-hexagon(in other words, there are only header files and binary programs/libs in this highly-tailored minimal-hexagon-sdk), that's a fully compliant manner and without any IPR concern/risk.

llvm-mingw-20250305-ggml-ucrt-x86_64.zip: a customized LLVM toolchain to build Project ggml-hexagon(a forked llama.cpp focus on a specified backend for Qualcomm NPU) for target WoA(Windows on ARM) on x86-64 Windows without huge VS2022 IDE(about 19G), size of this file is about 234M. This customized toolchain comes from https://github.com/mstorsjo/llvm-mingw/releases, the idea of this customized toolchain comes from:https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/pull/12215. This toolchain was verified on 03/2025 and might-be can't works at the moment because now I'm focus on Snapdragon mobile SoC based Android phone rather than Snapdragon desktop SoC based WoA(Windows on ARM).

minimal-hexagon-sdk-6.2.0.1.xz: a customized/tailored Hexagon SDK from Qualcomm's official Hexagon SDK 6.2.0.1, size of this file is about 516M. The purpose of this file is to simplify workflow of build ggml-hexagon. This toolchain was validated on a clean & fresh clone of ggml-hexagon, this toolchain is under maintenance.
